# 4.4 Probability
## Simple Events
## Experiments
- an **experiment** is a prcedure whose outcome cannot be precisely predicted
  - an experiment can be repeated infinitely many times and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes.
- The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is the **sample space**
- The **outcome** is the result of an experiment

## Sample Spaces
- Sample space is a set than can be **finite** or **infinite** in cardinality
- Sample space is **discrete** if it has infinitely many or countable infinity of elements
  - ie natural numbers
- Sample space is **continuous** if the elements of the sample space constitute a continuum.
  - ie real numbers

## Events
- A subset of the sample space is called an event
- if two events have an empty intersection, they are called mutually exclusive
  - They cannot both occur

## Permutations
- if **r** objects are chosen from a set of **n** distinct objects, any particular arrangment (or order) of those objects is called a **permutation**
- some permutations of {a,b,c,d}:
  - abcd
  - dcba
  <sub>n</sub>P<sub>r</sub>=n!/(n-r)!/
