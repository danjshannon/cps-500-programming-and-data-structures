# Week 10 Graphs!

> analysis of algorithms covers graphs more

## Adjacency Matrix
- notice storage is N<sup>2</sup>
- the graph itself is **sparse** (mostly zeros)
- a **dense** graph is one that is mostly ones
- fast, but uses a lot of memory

## Adjacency List
- array of lists
- O(n2) runtime possible
- quick if sparse matrix

## Shortest Paths
1. start by assuming the distance is infinity to every node
2. 

## Homework 10
- skip hw 9
- only implement 2 hashes from question 1.
- no programming in q 2

## Final Exam
- 4 questions
- same format as quizes
- one piece of code to write - one function
- one follow the code
- two short answers

- not covering basics explicitly - 
- no trees
- should know heaps, hashing
  - given a has value how are things going to go into the table?
- graps, bfs, dfs
