# Week 4 Math Review

***Quiz 1 Next Week***
*** Week 4 stuff not on quizes or final ***

## Topics:
- Logic
- Set Theory
- Predicate Logic
- Probability
- Sequences and Summations

## Logic
- True or false
  - Negation !
  - Conjunction &&
  - Disjunction ||
  - Exclusive or
  - Implicaiton &rarr;
    - order matters
    - only false case is when antecedent is true, and consequent is false
  - Biconditional &harr;
    - items must match
    - iff()

## Set
  - groups of objects
  - unordered
  - v={1,2,3,4}
  - can use ellipses
    - Q={1,2,3,...,9,10,11,...}

## Set builder notation
- Empty set = {} or &empty;
- singleton - set with one element
- &empty;&ne;{&empty;}

## Subset 
- s &sube; T 

## Cardinality

## Tuple
- Ordered set
- given tuples x,y
  - x=y iff x=y1, x2=y2 etc
  - order matters!
- 2-tuple is an ordered pair

## set operations
- union: &cup; combination of both sets
- intersection: &cap; exists in both sets
- difference (S-T)
- complement: all elements in U but not S
- disjoint: intersection of sets is &empty;

## Predicate Logic
- predicate function returns a truth value given an object.
  - A(x,y,z):[x+y=z]
- Quantifiers:
  - Universal - &forall; = for all
    - &forall; x P(x) = for all x, P(x) is true
  - Existential - &exist; = there exists
    - &exist; x P(x) = for P(x) there exists x that is makes it true
